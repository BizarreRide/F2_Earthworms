Dear Quentin,

IMHO, errorbars are more important than p-values. So yes, you need to present them. Here is an example

library(glmmADMB)
om <- glmmadmb(SiblingNegotiation~ FoodTreatment * SexParent +(1|Nest)+offset(log(BroodSize)),zeroInflation=TRUE,family="nbinom",data=Owls)
newdata <- expand.grid(
  FoodTreatment = unique(Owls$FoodTreatment),
  SexParent = unique(Owls$SexParent),
  BroodSize = 4
)
newdata <- cbind(newdata, predict(om, newdata = newdata, interval = "confidence"))

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(newdata, aes(x = FoodTreatment, colour = SexParent, y = exp(fit), ymin = exp(lwr), ymax = exp(upr))) + geom_errorbar(position = position_dodge(1)) + geom_point(position = position_dodge(1))

    Hello,

    Thank you for writing,

    I tried what you said, but simple addition of "offset(log(0.25))" did not work. Hence I created a factor "area" expressed as m² with the value 0.25 for all observations:
     data$area <- rep(0.25, 180)
    and added offset(log(area)) to the model formula.

    Ok, plotting the predicted values for all relevant combinations of the fixed effects was also my intention. However, the problem with the errorbars occured. Or is it a faulty assumption of mine, that plots of predicted values need error-bars?

    I'm sorry, i recognized that the answer was only adressed to you, after i send the mail. Then i send it again to the Mailing List, i hope it won't get to chaotic right now. Now i used "answer all"

    kind regards
