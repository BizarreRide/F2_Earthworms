Low Importance of cn, coud tht mean that the actual c content is not so important. Since C input comes primarily from litter input?
Furthermore it is thinkable that the state of C and N is controled and hold at similar levels in agricultural practices.
Next obviously there is no enrichment of c and n in the mineral soil layer, that is suffiecient for endogeics to react on. 
No Humification?? strong competition for food?
