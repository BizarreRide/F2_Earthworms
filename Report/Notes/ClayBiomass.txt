# Explanation for either anecic biomass increase due to higher abundance or increased individual weight

One site with high anecic biomass but low individual number was the one with the largest clay content. 
Reproductive activity or survival of juveniles is possibly negatively affected by soil physical properties. 
The clay content possibly forces juvenile anecics to abondon the soil, when conditions become too anaerobic in case of high soil moisture after rain fall. 
Adults may omit adverse conditions by crawling deeper into their burrows.
